"""
Created by Yanha Loharwad
Python program to convert decimal numbers to binary, octal, and hexadecimal representations and 
displaying the results.
"""
decimal = ["50", "24", "45", "89", "43"]
binary_representation = [bin(int(deci))[2:] for deci in decimal]
octal_representation = [oct(int(deci))[2:] for deci in decimal]
hexa_representation = [hex(int(deci))[2:] for deci in decimal]
print("Binary representation:", binary_representation)
print("Octal representation:", octal_representation)
print("Hexadecimal representation:", hexa_representation)
